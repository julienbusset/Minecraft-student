## Minecraft student

This is a plugin for Cuberite Minecraft server.
It puts an autonomous student in Minecraft, which can be educated. It’s a kind of AI, which works on a Lévinas’ basic principle: you are told to answer a look at you. It has also another basic principle: search for pleasure and avoid pain.

# Basic learning principle

To interact with the student, look at him. He will look at you and observe what you’ll do next. If you look at him a second time before it gets bored (you’ll know that when he doesn’t look at you anymore), he will try to reproduce what you did. Give him food to show him he’s right, or hit him (not to much, or he will fear you) to show him he did something wrong.
Actually, you understand it’s more like educating a dog.
